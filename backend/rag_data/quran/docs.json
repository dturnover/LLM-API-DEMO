But for their violation of their covenant, \nand their denial of Allah’s revelations, and \ntheir killing  of the prophets unjustly, and \ntheir saying, “Our minds are closed.” In fact, \nAllah has sealed them for their disbelief, so \nthey do not believe, except for a few. \n156. And for their faithlessness, and their say-\ning against Mary a monstrous slander. \n157. And for their saying, “We have killed the \nMessiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the Messen-\nger of Allah.” In fact, they did not kill him, \nnor did they crucify him, but it appeared to \nthem as if they did. Indeed, those who differ \nabout him are in doubt about it. The y have \nno knowledge of it, except the following of as-\nsumptions. Certainly, they did not kill him. \n158. Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself. \nAllah is Mighty and Wise. \n159. There is none from the People of the \nScripture but will believe in him before his \ndeath, and on the Day of Resurrection he will \nbe a witness against them. \n160.

But We \nleave those who do not expect Our encounter \nto blunder in their excesses. \n12. Whenever adversity touches the human \nbeing, he prays to Us —reclining on his side, \nor sitting, or standing. But when We have re-\nlieved his adversity from him, he goes away, \nas though he had never called on Us for trou-\nble that had afflicted him. Thus the deeds of \nthe transgressors appear good to them. \n13. We destroyed generations before you when \nthey did wrong. Their messengers came to \nthem with clear signs, but they would not be-\nlieve. Thus We requite the sinful people. \n14. Then We made you successors on earth af-\nter them, to see how you would behave. \n15. And when Our clear revelations are recited \nto them, those who do not hope to meet Us \nsay, “Bring a Quran other than this, or change \nit.” Say, “It is not for me to change it of my \nown accord.

She said, “What is the penalty \nfor him who desired to dishonor your wife, \nexcept imprisonment or a painful punish-\nment?” \n26. He said, “It was she who tried to seduce \nme.” A witness from her household sug-\ngested: “If his shirt is torn from the front: \nthen she has told the truth, and he is the liar. \n27. But if his shirt is torn from the back: then \nshe has lied, and he is the truthful.” \n28. And when he saw that his shirt was torn \nfrom the back, he said, “This is a woman's \nscheme.

These will enter Paradise, \nand will not be wronged in the least. \n61. The Gardens of Eden, promised by the \nMost Merciful to His servants in the Unseen. \nHis promise will certainly come true. \n62. They will hear no nonsense therein, but \nonly peace. And they will have their provision \ntherein, morning and evening. \n63. Such is Paradise which We will give as in-\nheritance to those of Our servants who are \ndevout. \n64. “We do not descend except by the com-\nmand of your Lord. His is what is before us, \nand what is behind us, and what is between \nthem. Your Lord is never forgetful.” \n65. Lord of the heavens and the earth and what \nis between them. So worship Him, and perse-\nvere in His service. Do you know of anyone \nequal to Him? \n66. And the human being says, “When I am \ndead, will I be brought back alive?” \n67. Does the human being not remember that \nWe created him before, when he was noth-\ning? \n68. By your Lord, We will round them up, and \nthe devils, then We will bring them around \nHell, on their knees. \n69.

It is We who revive the dead; and We write \ndown what they have forwarded, and their \ntraces. We have tallied all things in a Clear \nRecord. \n13. And cite for them the parable of the land-\nlords of the town —when the messengers \ncame to it. \n14. We sent them two messengers, but they de-\nnied them both, so We reinforced them with \na third. They said, “We are messengers to \nyou.” \n15. They sa id, “You are nothing but humans \nlike us, and the Gracious did not send down \nanything; you are only lying.” \n16. They said, “Our Lord knows that we are \nmessengers to you.  \n17. And our only duty is clear communica-\ntion.” \n18. They said, “We see an evil omen in you; if \nyou do not give up, we will stone you, and a \npainful punishment from us will befall you.” \n19. They said, “Your evil omen is upon you. Is \nit because you were reminded? But you are an \nextravagant people.” \n20. Then a man came running from the remot-\nest part of the city. He said, “O my people, \nfollow the messengers. \n",

We did not create the heaven and the earth \nand everything between them in vain. That is \nthe assumption of those who disbelieve —so \nwoe to those who disbelieve because of the \nFire. \n28. Or are We to treat those who believe and \ndo righteous deeds like those who make trou-\nble on earth? Or are We to treat the pious like \nthe shameless? \n29. A blessed Book that We sent down to you, \nthat they may ponder its Verses, and for those \nwith intelligence to take heed. \n30. And We granted David, Solomon, an ex-\ncellent servant. He was penitent. \n31. When the beautiful horses were paraded \nbefore him in the evening. \n32. He said, “I have preferred the love of nice-\nties to the remembrance of my Lord—until it \ndisappeared behind the veil. \n33. Bring them back to me.” And he began ca-\nressing their legs and necks. \n34. We tested Solomon, and placed a body on \nhis throne; then he repented. \n35. He said, “My Lord, forgive me, and grant \nme a kingdom never to be attained by anyone \nafter me. You are the Giver.” \n36. So We placed the wind at his service, blow-\ning gently by his command, wherever he di-\nrected. \n37. And the demons—every builder and diver. \n38. And others fettered in chains. \n39. “This is Our gift; so give generously, or \nwithhold; without account.” \n40. For him is nearness to Us, and a beautiful \nresort. \n41. And mention Our servant Job, when he \ncalled out to his Lord, “Satan has afflicted me \nwith hardship and pain.” \n42. “Stamp with your foot—here is cool water \nto wash with, and to drink.” \n43. And We restored his family for him, and \ntheir like with them; as a mercy from Us, and \na lesson for those who possess insight. \n44. “Take with your hand a bundle, and strike \nwith it,",

What an excellent serv-\nant! He was obedient. \n45. And mention Our servants Abraham, \nIsaac, and Jacob —endowed with ability and \nvision. \n46. We distinguished them with a distinct \nquality: the remembrance of the Home. \n47. To Us they are among the chosen, the out-\nstanding. \n48. And mention Ishmael, Elisha, and Ezekiel; \nall are among the outstanding. \n49. This is a reminder. The devout will have a \ngood place of return. \n50. The Gardens of Eden, with their doors \nwide-open for them. \n51. Relaxing therein, and calling for abundant \nfruit and beverage. \n52. With them will be attendants with modest \ngaze, of same age. \n53. This is what you are promised for the Day \nof Account. \n54. Such is Our bounty, inexhaustible.  \n55. All This. But the trans gressors will have a \nmiserable return. \n56. Hell; in which they will roast; what a mis-\nerable abode! \n57. All this. Let them taste it—boiling and bit-\nter cold. \n58. And similar torments of diverse kinds. \n59. “This is a crowd rushing headlong with \nyou.” There is  no welcome for them. They \nwill be scorched by the Fire. \n60. They will say, “But it is you! There is no \nwelcome for you! It is you who brought it \nupon us! What a miserable end!” \n61. They will say, “Our Lord, whoever brought \nthis upon us, give him double torment in the \nFire.”",

As for those who dispute about Allah after \nhaving answered His call, their argument is \ninvalid with their Lord; and upon them falls \nwrath; and a grievous torment awaits them. \n17. It is Allah who revealed the Book with the \ntruth, and the Balance. And what will make \nyou realize that perhaps the Hour is near? \n18. Those who do not believe in it seek to has-\nten it; but those who believe are apprehensive \nof it, and they know it to be the  truth. Abso-\nlutely, those who question the Hour are in \ndistant error. \n19. Allah is kind towards His worshipers. He \nprovides for whomever He wills. He is the \nPowerful, the Honorable. \n20. Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereaf-\nter, We increase for him his harvest; and \nwhoever desires the harvest of this world, We \ngive him thereof, and he has no share of the \nHereafter. \n21. Or is it that they have partners who litigate \nfor them religious laws never authorized by \nAllah? Were it not for the conclusive deci-\nsion, it would have been settled between \nthem. The wicked will have a painful punish-\nment. \n22. You will see the unjust terrified of what \nthey have earned, and it will befall them. As \nfor those who believe and do good deeds, \nthey will be in the Meadows of the Gardens; \nthey will have whatever they please in the \npresence of their Lord; that is the supreme \nblessing. \n23. That is the good news Allah gives to His \nservants who believe and do good deeds. Say, \n“I ask of you no wage for it, except affection \namong the near of kin.” Whoever does a good \ndeed, We will increase its goodness for him. \nAllah is Forgiving and Appreciative. \n24. Or do they say, “He forged a lie about Al-\nlah.” If Allah so willed, He could have sealed \nyour heart. But Allah obliterates the false, and \nconfirm the true by His Words.

And in the alternation of night and day, and \nin the sustenance Allah sends down from the \nsky, with which He revives the earth after its \ndeath, and in the circulation of the winds, are \nmarvels for people who reason. \n6. These are Allah’s Verses which We recite to \nyou in truth. In which message, after Allah \nand His revelations, will they believe? \n7. Woe to every sinful liar. \n8. Who hears Allah's revelations being recited \nto him, yet he persists arrogantly, as though \nhe did not hear them. Announce to him a \npainful punishment. \n9. And when he learns something of Our rev-\nelations, he takes them in mockery. For such \nthere is a shameful punishment. \n10. Beyond them lies Hell.

T hose who blaspheme \ntheir Lord’s revelations will have a punish-\nment of agonizing pain. \n12. It is Allah who placed the sea at your ser-\nvice, so that ships may run through it by His \ncommand, and that you may seek of His \nbounty, and that you may give thanks.  \n13. And He placed at your service whatever is \nin the heavens and whatever is on earth —all \nis from Him. In that are signs for a people \nwho think. \n14.
